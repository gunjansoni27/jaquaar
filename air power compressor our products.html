                  <li class="ollist1"> Single Stage</li>
                  <p>A single-stage screw air compressor is a type of rotary compressor that employs two interlocking helical
                     rotors to compress air efficiently. As these rotors turn, they draw in air, compress it, and then
                      discharge it. This design results in a compressor that is more efficient and durable than traditional 
                      reciprocating compressors, making it suitable for continuous operation. With fewer moving parts, 
                      single-stage screw compressors require less maintenance and tend to have a longer lifespan. 
                      They also operate more quietly and can be found in oil-free versions, which are essential for 
                      applications requiring clean air. Commonly used in manufacturing and automotive industries, these 
                      compressors provide a reliable and steady supply of compressed air, all while being relatively compact 
                      and easy to install in various settings.</p>
                  <li class="ollist1"> 2 Stage Premium Efficiency Energy Saving</li>
                  <p>A two-stage screw air compressor with premium efficiency is engineered for optimal energy savings and 
                    high-quality compressed air delivery. This design features two sets of helical rotors—one for initial
                     compression and another for further compression—allowing for higher compression ratios and improved overall
                      efficiency compared to single-stage models. By operating at lower discharge temperatures, these 
                      compressors significantly reduce the energy required for cooling, leading to substantial operational 
                      cost savings.</p>

                  <p>
                    A piston air compressor, also known as a reciprocating compressor, operates using a piston driven by a 
                    crankshaft to compress air within a cylinder. As the piston moves down, it creates a vacuum that draws air 
                    into the cylinder; when it moves back up, it compresses the air and forces it into a storage tank.
                     This type of compressor is known for its simplicity, affordability, and versatility, making it a popular
                      choice for a wide range of applications, from small workshops to large industrial settings. 
                      Piston compressors are available in both single-stage and multi-stage configurations, allowing for
                       various pressure outputs and capacities. While they tend to be noisier than rotary compressors and may 
                       require more maintenance due to their moving parts, their robust design and ability to generate high 
                       pressure make them effective for tasks such as powering pneumatic tools, inflating tires, and providing 
                       compressed air for manufacturing processes. Overall, piston air compressors remain a reliable option for
                        many users seeking efficient and powerful air compression solutions.
                        Available in single-stage and multi-stage configurations, they can achieve different pressure outputs.
                         While they may be noisier and require more maintenance than rotary compressors, their ability to
